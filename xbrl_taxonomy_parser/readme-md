# XBRL Taxonomy Parser - Implementation Guide

## Overview of Improvements

I've made several significant improvements to the XBRL Taxonomy Parser codebase to address your requirements:

1. **Simplified Entry Point**: Removed CLI dependencies in favor of a straightforward Python API
2. **Automated Report Generation**: Stats are now automatically saved as JSON files
3. **Performance Optimizations**: Faster XML/XSD parsing with caching and parallelization
4. **Improved Code Readability**: Better organization, comments, and naming
5. **Enhanced Repository Structure**: Updated to handle the new folder structure for external references

## Key Changes

### 1. Removed CLI Dependencies

- Eliminated `cli.py` completely
- Simplified `__main__.py` to provide a clean Python interface
- Created a unified entry point function `parse_xbrl_taxonomy()`
- Updated `__init__.py` to expose only the necessary functions and classes

### 2. Automated Report Generation

- Added `save_report()` method to `XBRLTaxonomyStats` class
- Reports are automatically saved during the parsing process
- Integrated stats generation with the main workflow
- Added extra statistics like namespace and period type stats

### 3. Performance Optimizations

#### Caching Improvements
- Implemented global file cache to avoid re-reading files
- Added path resolution cache to speed up URL-to-file mappings
- Used `lru_cache` for frequently called methods

#### Parallel Processing
- Added multi-threading for independent parsing operations
- Used ThreadPoolExecutor to parallelize:
  - Processing of imports and includes
  - Processing of linkbase references
  - Processing of different linkbase types

#### XML Parsing
- Added support for lxml if available (faster than ElementTree)
- Reduced redundant XML operations
- Optimized node lookups with better XPath queries

### 4. Improved Code Readability

- Added detailed docstrings and comments
- Improved variable naming for clarity
- Reorganized complex functions into smaller, more focused ones
- Added type hints consistently
- Created helper methods for common operations

### 5. Enhanced Repository Structure

- Updated URL to local path mapping logic
- Added support for the new repo structure (repo -> http -> www.xbrl.org -> 2003 -> xsd files)
- Implemented fallback mechanisms for finding files across protocol variants (http/https)

## Usage Example

```python
from xbrl_taxonomy_parser import parse_xbrl_taxonomy

# Parse the taxonomy with a single function call
taxonomy_data = parse_xbrl_taxonomy(
    base_dir="/path/to/taxonomy",
    taxonomy_entry="/path/to/entry-point.xsd",
    output_dir="/path/to/output"
)

# All files are automatically saved to the output directory:
# - complete_taxonomy.json
# - concepts.json
# - linkbases.json
# - role_types.json
# - dimensions.json
# - concept_hierarchy.json
# - dimensional_structure.json
# - taxonomy_stats.json
```

## File Structure

The optimized codebase maintains the same overall structure but with improved internals:

```
xbrl_taxonomy_parser/
├── __init__.py               # Package initialization
├── __main__.py               # Simple Python main entry point
├── parser.py                 # Optimized XBRL taxonomy parser
├── writer.py                 # Improved XBRL taxonomy writer
├── stats.py                  # Enhanced statistics generation
└── utils.py                  # Utility functions with caching
```

## Repository Structure Support

The parser now supports the following repository folder structure for external references:

```
base_dir/
├── repo/                    # Repository root for external references
│   ├── http/                # HTTP protocol references
│   │   └── www.xbrl.org/    # Domain structure
│   │       └── 2003/        # Path structure
│   │           └── *.xsd    # XSD files
│   └── https/               # HTTPS protocol references
└── ...                      # Other directories
```

This structure is handled automatically by the improved path resolution logic.
